# The boss ordered the employee to fill 330 ml bottles with liquid in such a way that 12% of the bottle was empty.
# The employee made an agreement with the boss that he could leave all the liquid that would remain for him and would
# not be enough to fill the bottles. After take-off, receive information from the user how many ml of fluid was supplied
# by the factory, and the result should be the amount of liquid that the employee will be able to take with him :)
